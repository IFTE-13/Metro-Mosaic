## ${\color{gray} Introduction}$
This project aims to create a simple representation of a city using C++ and GLUT. It leverages the power of OpenGL to render a 3D city view environment, displaying buildings, and other objects.

## ${\color{gray} Features}$
* Cityscape Rendering: Generates a visual representation of a city.
* Music: Integrated music for day, night, and rain mode.
* Basic Interactivity: Allows basic user interaction through the keyboard.
* C++ and GLUT: Developed using C++ programming language and GLUT library for OpenGL.

## ${\color{gray} Installation}$
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

* Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/city-view.git
* Build the Project: Use your preferred C++ compiler and ensure GLUT is properly linked.
* Run the Executable: Execute the generated executable file.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and GLUT installed on your system before running the project.

## ${\color{gray} Usage}$
After installation, execute the program to view the cityscape. If there are any interactive elements, follow on-screen prompts or controls (if available) to interact with the city view.

#### Key bindings for interactions
- d » **Day** Mode
- n » **Night** Mode
- 1 » Ghost eating doughnut signboard **enable**
- 2 » Ghost eating doughnut signboard **disable**
- 3 » Laser light **enable**
- 4 » Laser light **disable**
- 5 » **Active** rain
- 6 » **Deactive** rain
